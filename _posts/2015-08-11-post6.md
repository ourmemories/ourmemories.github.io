He and She, led a life, so far so away <br>
... they were a bit sad but hey!<br>
They still talked, gossiped abt their boss<br>
cribbed abt the dentist and her dental floss<br>

they had hangouts n they had chats <br>
n they saw videos of cute puppies n cats!<br>
the "net" had brought them close no par..<br>
they were soo close.. yet soo far :'(<br>

one day, they decided they want to be close <br/>
where they can kiss their lips n touch their nose!<br/>
and then... She worked for him .. day n night <br/>
prepared him for the exam .. with all her might<br/>

and yo! he got into ... the one place of choice<br/>
the one place .. where they can live n rejoice!<br/>
that day, ...they danced and they sang<br/>
and celebrated the day .. with a big bang!<br/>

then.. he went home, to say goodbyes n smiles<br/>
for the place of choice was apart by thousands miles<br/>
he met his childhood friends n his buddies<br/>
for it was a time for hugs n cuddies<br/>

But in all this chaos.. she became sad :( <br/>
For he was all engrossed with his mum n dad :'( <br/>
He has not time for his li'l baby .. she thought<br/>
when it was only his time, .. what she had sought<br/>

And then a day came.. all grey n dark<br/>
n she thought .. its better to be eaten by a shark<br/>
when suddently the almighty one appeared in head<br/>
"Why u worry li'l one" he said...<br/>

"you know why he is not talking to thee?" <br/>
"For he is busy singing your praise songs .. my dear sweetee"<br/>
"N why u fret, ...when he is going to be yours?"<br/>
"For life, all years, days n hours!"<br/>

And then came back the smile...:) <br/>
on the cutest face I know.. after a long while :D <br/>
waiting for him all along..<br/>
for he was going to come.. for good and for long! <br/>

-- for my dearest cutiepie :)<br/>
