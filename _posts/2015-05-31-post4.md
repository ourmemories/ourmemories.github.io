---

This is for my bestest friend ever. <br/> 
Who is with me in merry or in fever <br/>
For the friend.. who has shaped me:) <br/>
And made me Awesome.. like thee! <br/>

For my buddy.. with whom I fight <br/>
Like cats n dogs.. till it is night <br/>
But come bedtime.. all is merry :) <br/>
When i recite a sweet li'l story! <br/>

This is for you my dear.. my mate <br/>
I am really sorry .. that I am always late :'( <br/>
I will improve soon.. I swear <br/>
But, until then.. u ll have to bear ;) <br/>

Lubba my dear!
