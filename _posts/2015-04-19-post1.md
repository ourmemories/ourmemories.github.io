It was one such day!

  <center><i>
  "It was a heavy downpour <break>
   She offered me her umbrella <break>
   And I offered my heart :)""

 It was one of those memories which will always be with me! :)
 The scene was blue! You dressed in a mesmerising blue dress,
 lush green trees covering the deep-blue azure skies! I was a shy kid then, and was really nervous, barely being able to converse 
 with a girl I had a crush on. And the rain gods came to my rescue :)
 Showering those droplets of bliss, and love...
 It was almost surreal. The Blue Umbrella, small and pretty, compelled us to be together.
