Hi my dear,

We talk everyday, we see each other each day
It feels like you are with me... but still so far.
Sometimes it just makes me feel so lonenly.. :'(

I know we write e-letters emails to each other every other day.
But, somehow I just felt like writing a letter for you, yes a physical letter!
A letter, I was meant to send you a long time ago. 
Along with the letter, sending you some of your favourite things!

* **Ferrero Ladu** I know how much my dear loves these laddus! Filled 
with sweet milk chocolate for my sweet one. Every sweet occasion in our live deserves these laddus :)
* **Amba wadi** For my homesick li'l angel, something to cheer her up!
* **Imli candy** A bit of zing in life, for my *khatti-meethi* ladli
* **Maggi** *Maggi* jaise baal hai, to Maggi khaana banta hai!
* **Madhavji Bhel** I know you love this! ( probably more than me? :-|)
* and of course, lots of love!!
* **Surprise** Well this is a surprise!

How happy I was, to pack those stuff. I imagined you going on your small bike,
with a big smile on your face, to the post office!

I imagined you coming back with a Biiig box of goodies, sent to you by your best friend!
I imagined you opening the box, with tears of joy, and feasting on the laddus, the bhel, the imli!
I imagined you, with the gifts I am packing, the same physical gifts :)

The joy of sending a gift to my best friend is just something special, somethignout of the world :*
