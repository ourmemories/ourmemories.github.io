Its a beautiful day, bright and sunny <br/>
making me smile as cute as a bunny!<br/>
I look into her eyes with joy and fear<br/>
and say..."Will u marry me Oh my dear?"<br/>

She smiles... with eyes full of tears :')<br/>
those moments, seem like thousands of years<br/>
I look into her eyer, with a slight bit of nervous fright<br/>
they tell her a tale of our life, faster than speed of light!<br/>

We will Sing,... n we will dance!<br/>
we will roam the world, whenever we get a chance!<br/>
We will sleep under trees, and run in farms,<br/>
and will spend quite times, cuddled in our arms<br/>
